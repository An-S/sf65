** Â© Copyright 2017 Oscar Toledo G.
**
** Creation date: Nov/03/2017.
** Revision date: Nov/06/2017. Processor selection. Indents nested IF/ENDIF.
**                             Tries to preserve vertical structure of comments.
**                             Allows label in its own line. Allows to change case
**                             of mnemonics and directives.
**
** Changes introduced further:
** - Major code refactoring to increase maintainability and extensibility
**      In Detail:
**      - Added header file containing all important definitions and prototypes
**      - Sepearated repeated code into own procedures and put into a helper.c file
**      - Rewrote main loop using calls to these procedures instead of the former inline placement of the code
**      - Added header for datatype definitions, globbered global variables into structs
**      - Provided more named constants for alignment and expression types
**
** - Replaced DASM directives list with the CA65 directives

/* BUGTRACKER
 *
 * Comments at line start are not aligned with commands when requested
 *      -> Seems fixed, now (16.03.2018)
 * Mnemonics having args not separated by space are not recognized
 *      -> Is fixed for mnemonics which comes first in line
 *      -> 17./18.03.2018
 * Alignment of .proc/.scope/.endproc/.endscope is not satisfying
 *      -> Tried to solve that issue by placing scope directives 4 chars left of menemonics
 *      -> 17./18.03.2018
 * Mnemonics/directives after labels are recognized as operands
 *      -> Progress: The mnemonics are recognized as seen by the changed case. However, they are not in the correct column
 * (However, comments are correctly recignized and aligned with mnemonics)
 *         -> 19./20.03.2018
 * Labels are indented with section(.proc, .scope ...) directives
 *      -> Fixed in the way that labels are only indented with section when they are aligned with mnemonics
 *          -> 21.03.2018
 * Missing spaces after directives
 *      -> Fixed by remembering a found directive and issuing a space before processing the next term
 *          -> 21.03.2018
 * Missing spaces after labels
 *      -> Fixed for most cases but one: length of label is very large -> Fixed 21.03.2018
 * Data directives are not correctly placed with mnemonics
 *      -> Fixed by introducing ALIGN_MNEMONIC flag 19.03.2018
 * Extra linefeeds after comments
 *      -> Fixed, 20.03.2018
 * Removed linefeeds on empty lines
 *      -> Problem persists after directives in prev line -> Fixed 21.03.2018
 * If unformatted source contains mnemonics which reference to variables
 * then operands are separated by space instead of using start_operand column
 *      -> fixed, by remembering found mnemonic and formatting following statement
 *         at start_operand column
 *
 * When variables are assigned to an hexadecimal value, sf65 outputs space between $ and xdigits,
 * which cause syntax error
 *      -> Fixed, 14.04.2018
 *
 * Missing command line options
 *
 * Reintegrated possibility to choose between extra operand column and
 * operand separated by single space -> 23.03.2018
 *
 * In mode which breaks long labels and rest of line into each one line, also variable assignments
 * are beeing broken into two lines. However, this does not make sense.
 *
 * The flag that specifies alignment of comments to nearest column is ignored
 *
 * Labels starting in first line of source are aligned with mnemonics
 *
 */

/* MISSING FEATURES
 *
 * Colons cannot be added/removed from labels
 * Put overlengthy labels into own line
 * Format comma separated data tables to nearest tab stop
 * After directives like .byte, align first data entry to mnemonics
 * Add one space after each comma in data tables, remove spaces before commas
 * Format arguments of directives so they are aligned with opcodes
 */

/* UNSUPPORTED FEATURES
 *
 * cheap locals are not detected as such (they have @ as first char instead of 'a-zA-Z' or '_'
 * .LOCALCHAR, .features at_in_identifiers, dollar_in_identifiers,
 * leading_dot_in_identifiers may break things
